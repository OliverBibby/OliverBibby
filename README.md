Hello. This is my ReadMe file for the SHU school system project.

For this project, I have used Node.JS as this is the code I work with daily, and due to the demand from the workplace, this had been chosen.
In this file, i will explain briefly the different aspects of my code, as well as attaching this. 

This project starts by using index.html, then I have created 2 files. Main.JS and Module.JS. As well as using a style.css sheet.
